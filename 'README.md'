## My process
First Step: I downloaded the challenge from Frontend Mentor website (www.frontendmentor.io)

step 2: I extracted the file and opened it with VScode to start the challenge.

step 3: I imported the image, created the div elements, the various classes using index.html.

step 4: made use of CSS custom properties to create and align the body, container and text to the middle.body {
    font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
    background-color:  hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    min-height: (100vh-1);
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    font-size: 15px;
} 
* {
    margin:0%;
    padding: 0%;
}
.container {
    margin: auto;
    max-width: 360px;
    align-items: center;
    margin-bottom: 2rem;
}
.card {
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    padding: 11px;
    border-radius: 18px;
    text-align: center;

}
.card img {
    width: 100%; 
    border-radius: 12px; 
}
.text {
    text-align: center; 
}
h2 {
    color: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
    padding: 15px;
}
p {
    color: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
    padding: 15px;
}
.attribution {
    .attribution { font-size: 11px; text-align: center; }
    .attribution a { color: hsl(228, 45%, 44%); }

}
    
    
@media (min-width: 500px)
.container {
    width: 400px;
}


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned the right use of some of CSS properties such as margin, border-radius, padding and media querry and their functions. i got fmiliarised with creating CSS classes.

<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of is div; this is because it can be used to create some classes and made the styling easier </h1>

.proud-of-this-css {i love all the css properties i used in this project. each and everyone of them have its own peculiarity and all of them contriuted greatly in making the project a success.
  
### Continued development

I will continue focusing on the use of display flex and @media. i have not completely understand the function and its application.
